# Description

# Approach
Just ask you to design a linked list with 5 methods. MyLinkedList for initialize, get for fet a index of value, addAtHead, addAtIndex, deleteAtIndex is just like it name told.

(Hint: dummy be a unchanged head. It's just a pointer point out the address of linked list head.)
