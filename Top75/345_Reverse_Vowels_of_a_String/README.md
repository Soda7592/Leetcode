# Description
# Approach
I think the best solution is two pointer.
Because it only take O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

A left pointer from 0 to size()-1 and right pointer does the opposite.
If left pointer find a vowel, Starting right pointer traversal action to find a vowel.

If find a vowel from right hand side, swaping both of their value.
