# Description
Given a string s of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (i.e. left substring and right substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "011101"
Output: 5 
Explanation: 
All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5 
left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4 
left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3 
left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2 
left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3
Example 2:

Input: s = "00111"
Output: 5
Explanation: When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5
Example 3:

Input: s = "1111"
Output: 3

# Approach

We need to divide input string to two part of substirng, then calculate `zeros` in left part string and `ones` in right part. 

here is a key points u can follow: 
- There must exist two substring, that said left part or right part string lenght is at least 1. 

So we can create two prefix array to store sum for `left` part string and `right` part.
Finally find a max sum for two prefix array that is a answer for this question.
